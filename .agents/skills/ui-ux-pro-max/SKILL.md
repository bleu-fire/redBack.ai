# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Searchable local UI/UX guidance: 79 searchable styles (50 active), 192 product palettes and exact reasoning profiles, 74 font pairings, 119 UX guidelines, 105 curated icons, 17 GSAP presets, 25 chart types, and 22 technology stacks.

## When to Apply

Use this Skill when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**: designing new pages, creating/refactoring UI components, choosing color/typography/spacing/layout systems, reviewing UI for UX/accessibility/consistency, implementing navigation/animation/responsive behavior, or improving perceived quality and usability.

Skip it for pure backend logic, API/database design, non-visual performance work, infrastructure/DevOps, or non-visual scripts — unless the task changes how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.
